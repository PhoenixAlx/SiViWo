I have added the issues of goal 3 and other to learn new things.

###Goal 3

* Add in model0 agents and networks
* Create class for networks
* Create class for agents

###Learning:

* The idea is to update the web of project when the readme.md is update. I think so that i got it
* Seach modules in python that do it or to develope my own module. I have found this library in python [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Following with the idea the milestones I have opened a milestone to join the different points that correspond to the goal 1

###Goal 1

* Create file of roadmap
* Create Milestones
* Create issues
* To group issues in milestones
* Create brief description in readme's file
* Create file to describe the model 0 in spanish
* Create file to describe the model 0 in english

Also I have included a brief description of the model 0 in:
* [English] (https://github.com/PhoenixAlx/SiViWo/blob/master/model_0/description_en.md)
* [Spanish] (https://github.com/PhoenixAlx/SiViWo/blob/master/model_0/description_es.md)


I have encouraged and have started and finished the Goals 2
